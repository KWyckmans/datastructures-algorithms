# Datastructures and algorithms 
In this repository I implemented various datastructures and algorithms for personal practice. In reality I would (and so should you) absolutely use built-in versions of these.

This was performed as an exercise while applying to various companies. It was not my goal to produce production-level code, but rather freshen up my understanding of how various datastructures work combined with a bith of a refresher about Java. If their are things in this codebase that look weird, it's probably because I was experimenting with various things.

## Datastructures
The datastructures implemented are:
* LinkedList
* Queue
* Stack
* Binary tree
* HashMap

# Integrations
Used this opportunity to test various github integrations:
